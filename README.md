# 🌐 Network Request Automation – ServiceNow

## 📝 Project Description
The **Network Request Automation** project is designed to digitize and automate the process of submitting, approving, and tracking **network service requests** in ServiceNow.  
Traditionally, these requests were handled manually (emails, spreadsheets, calls), causing **delays, inefficiencies, and lack of traceability**.  

This project introduces a **self-service catalog item** that allows employees to submit requests, which are then automatically:
- Stored in a **custom table**,
- Routed for **approvals**,
- Sent as **email notifications**,
- Updated in **real-time with final status**.  

This solution is scalable, reusable, and production-oriented – a perfect demonstration of **ServiceNow Flow Designer, Catalog Items, Notifications, and Approvals**.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Provide a **centralized catalog item** for all network-related requests.  
- Reduce manual interventions by automating **approvals, record creation, and notifications**.  
- Ensure **data consistency** via a custom database table.  
- Deliver **real-time communication** using automated emails.  
- Design with **scalability and reusability** in mind.
